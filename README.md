## Dotfiles for BSPWM by Paul
# How to install:

```
./install.sh
```
* If it wont work try to `chmod` the file.
* Reboot and enjoy!

# FAQ
1. Why is there no bar?  
* This config of bswpm is only for cosmetics and not for casual use. You can add a bar by yourself.  

2. Are I can't open the Terminal.  
* You have to use a finished install of BSPWM before using these dots. So I expect that you have at least sxhkd installed.
